<!--
This element extends core-ajax element. It exposes the same API (docs: https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-ajax).

A connection point between core-ajax component and core-localstorage, where
the content downloaded from the server, can be cached on the localstorage, if that is the wish of the user.
This element extends the core-ajax element exposing the same interface (events and attributes).
Value is cached in the local storage as the MD5 hash from the xhrArgs object (request object).
If some value is found in cache, it is returned to through the core-response event. The detail.response
property will contain the object returned from cache. It is the same property as in case of
core-ajax and it's usual response.

If user will start the ajax request for the first time, he/she should get just one callback of
core-response handler. On any consecutive same ajax request, data will be taken from cache,
before returning the value from server (core-response event callback will fire twice).

##### Example

<cachable-ajax
auto
url="http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/"
params='{"alt":"json", "q":"chrome"}'
handleAs="json"
on-core-response="{{handleResponse}}"
cacheResponse="true"
key="localStorageKey"></cachable-ajax>
